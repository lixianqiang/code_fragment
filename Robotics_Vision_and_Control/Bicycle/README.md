# Bicycle Kinematic Model and its Control Law for motion
--------------------------------------

### **Note:** 
1. If result does not match expectation while you running program, that due to my kinematic model imperfect. Changing the model's parameter in BicycleKinematic.m such as limitation of steer and its angle velocity
2. my code is written according to the fourth chapter of the book < Robotics,Vision and Control >. If you want to use it in actual scene that need to add some termination conditions.
